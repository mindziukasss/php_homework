1. Why Nfq/Akademija/Soft/calculateHomeworkSum(3, 2.2, '1') is 6?

    Because all parameters are converted to integers.
    
2. What happened when you tried to invite Nfq/Akademija/Strict/calculateHomeworkSum(3, 2.2, '1')?

    Accepted the spread of the operator, turned it into an array, and could not continue to file, because the request was int.
